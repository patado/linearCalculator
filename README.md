Imagine a new library opened in town. It has 10 books, and 5 members (declared in main for instance - adults and children). The program would record the borrowing of books (constructor for loan objects), setting up new members (constructor for Member), setting up new books (constructor for books), print reports of books on loan, books overdue, set fines, setting up letters to call for overdue books (with labels in StringBuilder)...

For instance one of us could set the main, the member class, the book class, the fines class, the loan class..
